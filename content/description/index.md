## Project Description

We are exposed to numerous environmental chemical mixtures daily. We are interested in quantifying the health effects of environmental chemical mixtures, assessing joint actions, and identifying the interactions of combined chemicals. Analyzing health effects of chemical exposures can contribute to preventive measures to mitigate the potential impact of these exposures.

In this project, we aim to summarize advanced statistical approaches and knit them to R tutorials to make them accessible to researchers without a solid mathematics background. Our first goal is using jupyter notebook to build a workflow to collect data and merge data automatically. Our second goal is to create online tutorials to introduce advanced statistical approaches to the general public and provide examples to realize these methods.

## Project Objectives

In this project, you will ...

-   learn advanced statistical approaches on analyzing chemical mixtures
-   comprehend these methods and communicate them with people without a solid statistical background
-   be familiar with the R language, and able to apply these methods to answer scientific questions using R
-   use R Markdown to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration

By the end of the semester, we will have ...

-   a Jupyter notebook automatically collect and merge data
-   an online tutorial (this website) introducing statistical approaches for chemical mixtures analysis and applications using R
-   For students interested in research, we may consider a new research project focusing on developing statistical models and methods for environmental chemical mixtures.
