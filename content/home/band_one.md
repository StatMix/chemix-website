Tutorials summarizing advanced statistical approaches analyzing chemical mixtures with applications using R. We aim to make advanced statistical approaches accessible to researchers without a solid mathematics background. Our first goal is using jupyter notebook to build a workflow to collect data and merge data automatically. Our second goal is to create online tutorials to introduce advanced statistical approaches to the general public and provide examples to realize these methods.
