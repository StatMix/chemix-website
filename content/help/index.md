## Getting help in the course

We expect everyone will have questions at some point in the semester, so we encourage you to use the following resources for help: 

## Ask questions during lectures and lab

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

## Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

You can find the schedule for office hours and associated links for online office hours in Sakai.

## Ed Discussion

Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/8350/discussion/). There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Ed Discussion before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond! 

## Email 

If you have questions about personal matters that are not appropriate for the public forum on Piazza (e.g. illness, accommodations, etc.), you may email Professor Tackett at [maria.tackett@duke.edu](mailto:maria.tackett@duke.edu).
