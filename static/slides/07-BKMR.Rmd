## Background & Introduction 

Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) is a popular tool in machine learning literature which flexibly models the relationship between a large number of variables and a particular dependent outcome variable.

## Topics 

- Advantages of BKMR through flexibility of kernal function, hierarchical variable selection 

- Demonstrating the ability of BKMR to model highly correlated predictors through URX variables in the chemical dataset using the Gaussian kernel

- Bayesian model diagnostics through effective sample size (ESS) and autocorrelation

## 1. Definitions

We consider the general framework

$$g(\mu_i) = h(z_{i1},...z{iM})+\beta x_i \space i=1,...,n$$
