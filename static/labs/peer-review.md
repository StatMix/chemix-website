# Peer review questions 

## Issue 1: Introduction + Data

- Is the research question and goal of the report clearly stated? 
- Does the introduction provide appropriate background context and motivation for a general reader?
- Is the source of the data stated with an appropriate citation? 
- Is it clear when and how the data was originally collected?
- Are the observations and relevant variables described?

- Do the visualizations correspond to the to the stated research question? 
- Are visualizations effective and do they follow the visualization principles
we have discussed in STA 199? This includes using plots that are appropriate for the data, having proper axis labels, titles, etc. 
- Is the choice of statistical method justified?
- Include any additional comments or suggestions for the exploratory data analysis. 

## Issue 3: Methodology + Results

- Is the research question answered accurately and effectively? 
- Is the answer to the research question summarized and supported by statistical arguments?
- Are limitations of the analysis clearly outlined?

## Issue 4: Writing + Reproducibility

- Is the writing clear (including elements like spelling, grammar, etc)? Are you able to follow what is being done?
- Is the coding written clearly and generally using tidyverse syntax? Are you able to follow precisely what is being done? *Use the .Rmd file to assess this question if the code is suppressed in the PDF.*
- Knit the .Rmd file. Are you able to reproduce all aspects of the report, including output, 
visualizations, etc? This includes (1) being able to knit the document and (2) obtaining the same PDF as the original PDF. 
- Is the report well-formatted and readable (including layout but also only 
reporting relevant output, with no extraneous code, visuals, etc)?
- Have they appropriate outlined the next steps with gaps clearly defined?
- What is one thing the group has done well? what is one suggestion you have for the group going forward?
